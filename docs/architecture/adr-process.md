# ADR Process

This document describes the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) process used in the Floxide framework.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software system. They provide a record of what decisions were made, why they were made, and what alternatives were considered.

## Why Use ADRs?

ADRs serve several important purposes in the Floxide project:

1. **Documentation**: They provide a clear record of architectural decisions.
2. **Context Preservation**: They capture the context and reasoning behind decisions.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: They help new contributors understand the architecture.
4. **Decision Making**: They provide a structured process for making and reviewing architectural decisions.

## ADR Process in Floxide

In the Floxide framework, we follow a specific process for creating and managing ADRs:

### ADR Creation and Process

1. **Numbering**: ADRs are numbered sequentially with a four-digit number prefix (e.g., `0001`, `0002`).
2. **Format**: ADRs are stored as Markdown files in the `/docs/adrs/` directory.
3. **Naming Convention**: ADR files are named with their number and a kebab-case title, e.g., `0001-adr-process-and-format.md`.
4. **Creation Timing**: ADRs must be created before implementing any architectural decision, not after.
5. **Incremental Creation**: ADRs can be created incrementally as decisions are made throughout the project.

### ADR Content Structure

Each ADR includes:

1. **Title**: A clear, descriptive title following the format "ADR-NNNN: Title"
2. **Status**: One of:
   - `Proposed`: Initial state when the ADR is first drafted
   - `Accepted`: Approved for implementation
   - `Rejected`: Declined, with reasons documented
   - `Superseded`: Replaced by a newer ADR (with reference to the new ADR)
   - `Amended`: Modified after implementation
3. **Date**: The date the ADR was last updated
4. **Context**: The problem being addressed and relevant background information
5. **Decision**: The architectural decision that was made and the reasoning
6. **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative
7. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated and why they were not chosen

### ADR Lifecycle Management

1. **Review Process**: ADRs are reviewed before they are accepted.
2. **Amendments**: Existing ADRs can be amended with additional information, but the core decisions should not be changed after implementation.
3. **Superseding**: If a decision changes fundamentally, a new ADR should be created that supersedes the old one. The old ADR should be updated to reference the new one.
4. **Retrospective Updates**: Consequences that were not anticipated can be added to ADRs after implementation to serve as a record for future reference.

## ADR Index

An index of all ADRs is maintained in `/docs/adrs/README.md` to provide a central reference point. You can also view all ADRs in the [ADRs section](../adrs/README.md) of the documentation.

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

1. Identify an architectural decision that needs to be documented.
2. Determine the next available ADR number.
3. Create a new Markdown file in the `/docs/adrs/` directory using the naming convention.
4. Use the [ADR template](../adrs/adr-template.md) as a starting point.
5. Fill in the sections of the ADR with the relevant information.
6. Submit the ADR for review.

## Conclusion

The ADR process is a critical part of the Floxide framework's development approach. By documenting architectural decisions in a structured way, we ensure that the project's architecture is well-understood, maintainable, and evolves in a controlled manner.
