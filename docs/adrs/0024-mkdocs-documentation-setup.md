# ADR-0024: MkDocs Documentation Setup with Terminal Theme

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2025-02-27

## Context

The Floxide project has extensive documentation in the form of ADRs, guides, and examples. However, this documentation is currently scattered across different directories and lacks a cohesive, easily navigable structure. To improve the developer experience and make the documentation more accessible, we need a documentation site that:

1. Presents all documentation in a unified, searchable format
2. Provides clear navigation between different documentation types
3. Renders Markdown files with proper syntax highlighting
4. Aligns with the project's technical nature through an appropriate theme
5. Is easy to maintain and extend as the project grows

MkDocs is a popular static site generator specifically designed for project documentation. It uses Markdown files as its source format, which aligns with our existing documentation approach. Additionally, there are terminal-themed options available that would match the technical nature of the Floxide project.

## Decision

We will implement MkDocs with a terminal theme for the Floxide project documentation. Specifically:

1. Use MkDocs as the documentation site generator
2. Implement the "terminal" theme to align with the project's technical nature
3. Organize documentation into a clear hierarchy:
   - Getting Started
   - Core Concepts
   - Guides
   - API Reference
   - Examples
   - Architecture (ADRs)
4. Configure automatic deployment of the documentation site through GitHub Pages
5. Include search functionality for easy navigation
6. Ensure proper syntax highlighting for Rust code examples

## Consequences

### Advantages

- Improved developer experience with a unified, searchable documentation site
- Better organization of existing documentation
- Easier maintenance of documentation alongside code
- Improved discoverability of project features and patterns
- Professional appearance that aligns with the project's technical nature
- Simplified onboarding for new contributors

### Disadvantages

- Additional dependency on MkDocs and its requirements
- Need for ongoing maintenance of the documentation structure
- Potential for documentation to become outdated if not actively maintained

### Migration Path

1. Install MkDocs and required plugins
2. Create initial configuration in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Organize existing documentation into the new structure
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
5. Update contribution guidelines to include documentation practices

## Alternatives Considered

### Rust-specific documentation tools (mdBook)

mdBook is a documentation tool created by the Rust team and used for the Rust documentation. While it would align well with a Rust project, MkDocs offers more flexibility in themes and plugins, particularly for the terminal theme requirement.

### GitHub Wiki

GitHub's built-in wiki would require minimal setup but lacks the customization options and local development capabilities that MkDocs provides.

### Custom documentation site

Building a custom documentation site would offer maximum flexibility but would require significantly more development and maintenance effort.

## Implementation Notes

The implementation will include:

1. Installing MkDocs and the terminal theme
2. Creating a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file
3. Organizing existing documentation into the new structure
4. Setting up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
5. Adding search functionality
6. Configuring syntax highlighting for Rust code
