# ADR-0022: Documentation Structure and Cross-References

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-02-25

## Context

The Floxide framework's documentation needed to be more cohesive and better organized to help users understand and effectively use the framework. The documentation was spread across multiple locations with inconsistent cross-referencing and varying levels of detail.

Key issues that needed to be addressed:
1. Inconsistent documentation formats across different components
2. Missing or outdated architectural documentation
3. Lack of clear cross-references between related documents
4. Incomplete API documentation for some components
5. Examples that didn't fully demonstrate best practices

## Decision

We have decided to implement a comprehensive documentation structure with the following components:

1. **API Documentation**
   - Detailed documentation for each crate
   - Clear examples showing proper usage
   - Links to relevant architectural docs
   - Consistent format across all APIs

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Core Framework Abstractions
   - Node Lifecycle Methods
   - Event-Driven Workflow Pattern
   - Batch Processing Implementation
   - Async Runtime Selection

3. **Examples**
   - Basic workflow demonstrating core concepts
   - Specialized examples for each pattern
   - Error handling demonstrations
   - Best practices implementation

4. **Cross-References**
   - Clear links between related documents
   - References to relevant ADRs
   - Links to example implementations
   - References to external resources

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Usability**
   - Easier for new users to understand the framework
   - Clear path from basic to advanced usage
   - Better understanding of architectural decisions

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Consistent documentation format
   - Clear relationships between components
   - Easier to identify missing documentation

3. **Enhanced Quality**
   - Examples demonstrate best practices
   - Error handling is clearly documented
   - Architecture decisions are well-explained

### Negative

1. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - More documentation to keep updated
   - Need to maintain cross-references
   - Regular reviews required

2. **Potential Inconsistencies**
   - Risk of docs becoming outdated
   - Need to coordinate updates across files
   - More places to check when making changes

## Implementation

The documentation has been updated to follow this structure:

1. **API Documentation**
   - Updated floxide-reactive.md
   - Updated floxide-timer.md
   - Updated floxide-core.md
   - Added comprehensive examples

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Created/updated core architecture docs
   - Added cross-references
   - Improved consistency

3. **Examples**
   - Updated basic-workflow.md
   - Added error handling examples
   - Demonstrated best practices

4. **Cross-References**
   - Added links between related docs
   - Referenced relevant ADRs
   - Updated navigation structure
