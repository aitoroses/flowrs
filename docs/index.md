# üöÄ Floxide: The Power of Workflows in Rust

> A type-safe, composable directed graph workflow system written in Rust.

## üí´ Overview

Floxide transforms complex workflow orchestration into a delightful experience. Built with Rust's powerful type system at its core, Floxide provides a flexible, performant, and type-safe way to create sophisticated workflow graphs with crystal-clear transitions between steps.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîí Type-Safe By Design**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time workflow correctness
- **üß© Composable Architecture**: Build complex workflows from simple, reusable components
- **‚ö° Async First**: Native support for asynchronous execution with Tokio
- **üîÑ Advanced Patterns**: Support for batch processing, event-driven workflows, and more
- **üíæ State Management**: Built-in serialization for workflow persistence
- **üîç Observability**: Comprehensive tracing and monitoring capabilities
- **üß™ Testable**: Design your workflows for easy testing and verification

## üìê Architectural Decisions

This project follows documented architectural decisions recorded in ADRs (Architectural Decision Records). Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of significant architectural choices.

Key architectural decisions include:

- **Core Framework Abstractions** - Defining the fundamental abstractions like Node, Action, and Workflow with a trait-based approach for type safety and flexibility.
- **Project Structure and Crate Organization** - Organizing the framework as a Cargo workspace with multiple specialized crates for modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Async Runtime Selection** - Choosing Tokio as the primary async runtime for its comprehensive feature set and wide adoption.
- **Node Lifecycle Methods** - Implementing a three-phase lifecycle (prep/exec/post) for workflow nodes to provide clear separation of concerns.
- **Batch Processing Implementation** - Designing a batch processing system that efficiently handles parallel execution with configurable concurrency limits.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Add Floxide to your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
floxide-core = "0.1.0"
```

Create your first workflow:

```rust
use floxide_core::{lifecycle_node, LifecycleNode, Workflow, DefaultAction, FloxideError};
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Define your context type
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct MessageContext {
    input: String,
    result: Option<String>,
}

// Create a node using the convenience function
fn create_processor_node() -> impl LifecycleNode<MessageContext, DefaultAction> {
    lifecycle_node(
        Some("processor"), // Node ID
        |ctx: &mut MessageContext| async move {
            // Preparation phase
            println!("Preparing to process: {}", ctx.input);
            Ok(ctx.input.clone())
        },
        |input: String| async move {
            // Execution phase
            println!("Processing message...");
            Ok(format!("‚úÖ Processed: {}", input))
        },
        |_prep, exec_result, ctx: &mut MessageContext| async move {
            // Post-processing phase
            ctx.result = Some(exec_result);
            Ok(DefaultAction::Next)
        },
    )
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a context
    let mut context = MessageContext {
        input: "Hello, Floxide!".to_string(),
        result: None,
    };

    // Create a node and workflow
    let node = Arc::new(create_processor_node());
    let mut workflow = Workflow::new(node);

    // Execute the workflow
    workflow.execute(&mut context).await?;

    // Print the result
    println!("Result: {:?}", context.result);

    Ok(())
}
```

## üß© Workflow Pattern Examples

Floxide supports a wide variety of workflow patterns through its modular crate system. Each pattern is designed to solve specific workflow challenges:

### üîÑ Simple Chain (Linear Workflow)

A basic sequence of nodes executed one after another. This is the foundation of all workflows.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Process Data"] --> B["Format Output"] --> C["Store Result"]
    style A fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
```

### üå≤ Conditional Branching

Workflows that make decisions based on context data or node results, directing flow through different paths.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Validate Input"] -->|Valid| B["Process Data"]
    A -->|Invalid| C["Error Handler"]
    B -->|Success| D["Format Output"]
    B -->|Error| C
    style A fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#e53935,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#c4e6ff,stroke:#1a73e8,stroke-width:2px
```

### üîÄ Parallel Batch Processing

Process multiple items concurrently with controlled parallelism, ideal for high-throughput data processing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Batch Input"] --> B["Split Batch"]
    B --> C1["Process Item 1"]
    B --> C2["Process Item 2"]
    B --> C3["Process Item 3"]
    C1 --> D["Aggregate Results"]
    C2 --> D
    C3 --> D
    style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style C1 fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style C2 fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style C3 fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
```
